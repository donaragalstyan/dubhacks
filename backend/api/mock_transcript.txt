"Hi everyone, um, my name is Kenza, and today I’ll be talking about our new student app project. So, uh, the app helps students improve their presentation skills by giving feedback on tone, clarity, and pace. You know, it also tracks filler words like ‘um’ and ‘uh’, which can be distracting. Our team built this app using AWS tools, and, like, we’re really excited to see how it can help students become more confident speakers. Thank you for listening."
